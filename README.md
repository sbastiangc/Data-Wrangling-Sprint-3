# Data-Wrangling-Sprint-3
Instacart: grocery delivery platform - shopping habits of customers.

# Project description

**Instacart is a grocery delivery platform** where customers can place a grocery order and have it delivered to them, similar to how Uber Eats and Door Dash work. **This particular dataset was publicly released by Instacart in 2017 for a Kaggle competition**. Although the original dataset is no longer available on the Instacart website, weâ€™ve created CSV files that contain a modified version of that data. Download these files and use them for your project. 

Your mission is to **clean up the data and prepare a report that gives insight into the shopping habits of Instacart customers.**

# Data:
1) **instacart_orders.csv:** each row corresponds to one order on the Instacart app.
2) **products.csv:** each row corresponds to a unique product that customers can buy.
3) **order_products.csv** each row corresponds to one item placed in an order.
4) **aisles.csv** each row has the aisles information of instacart.
5) **departments.csv** uniquely identifies each grocery department category.
